**[Sunday, 06 June 2021]**

At some point in my life, I realize that I always have to meet someone expectations. Family, friends, exes, teachers, co-workers, and the list goes on. As long as I can remember, very few of them told me that I don't  have to meet their expectations.

While doing something that meet their expectations makes me feel I fit the society, there's some part of me that think this is painful. Am I not worth as I think I am if I don't? Is that how we measure someone? Is that how *I* measure *myself* ?

Just now, this is one of my source of pain. I believe, me as human, really wanted to reduce the pain. Part of life, is how we manage our pain. Then... I think I need to adjust my personal view on what if I don't meet someone expectations.

I need to accept that someone may have different perspective on something. I need to accept that everyone can have their own journey in this life. I need to accept that I can satisfy everyone. I have to accept, in the end, what I really need to do is stay true to myself.
