# Ch. 1 - Intro to Programming
- In a computer language, a group of words, numbers, and operators that performs a specific task is a _statement_.
	```javascript
	a = b * 2;
	```
- The characters `a` and `b` are called _variables_, which are like simple boxes you can store any of your stuff in.
- The `=` and `*` characters are _operators_ â€”they perform actions with the values and variables such as assignment and mathematic multiplication.
- An expression is any reference to a variable or value, or a set of variable(s) and value(s) combined with operators.
	```javascript
	a = b * 2;
	alert(a);
	```
	- `2` -> _literal value expression_
	- `b` -> _variable expression_
	- `b*2` -> _arithmetic expression_
	- `a = b * 2` -> _assignment expression_
	- `alert(a)` -> _call expression_
